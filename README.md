# voting_system
Write a smart contract that transparent, tamper-proof, and auditable voting system where registered users can vote for candidates, and the results are securely stored on the blockchain.
 
The system should be able to:
 
Register candidates.
Register voters (one-time registration).
Allow voters to cast a vote.
Allow authorized users to view the voting results.
Ensure only valid and registered users can vote, and votes cannot be changed or tampered with after being cast.
 
Demonstrate the above use cases with the test suite.
